# POKÉMON POKÉDEX

## Introduction:
Welcome to our amazing Pokémon team building project! We have worked very hard to create a functioning website with the goal of making your own desired team. Users are able to select from the first 151 pokémon of Generation 1 and view their data to decide if they want them on their team. Pokémon can be added to the team container and removed later on if users change their mind. If users are content with their teams, they may name it whatever they like and save their team into a list.

Make sure to run db.json before using the website
“json-server --watch db.json

## Our project includes the following features:
* Displays the 151 pokémon over 4 pages with each one containing 40
* Pokémon sprites are able to shake when hovered over
* Showcases pokémon name, image, and type in a container when clicked
* “Add to team”, “remove”, “remove from team” buttons to customize teams
* Shows which pokémon has been obtained
* Maximum of 6 pokémon can be added to your team
* When pokémon is selected from display, automatically jumps to top of page for easier user experience
* Teams can be saved to JSON server and teams will persist even when refreshed
